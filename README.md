# Whack-a-Mole-Game
This is the 'Whack A Mole Game' I've been working on. This program is still in development and requires polishing. For the moment being, score, cursor inputs, and appearance of mole within random coordinates, is working as intended. Changes I will be making: Implementing holes from which the mole can only appear from, and cursor into a mallet.
